    <ul>
        <li>cooking spray</li>
        <li>2 cups uncooked elbow macaroni</li>
        <li>Â½ cup butter</li>
        <li>2 (12 ounce) cans evaporated milk</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon ground black pepper</li>
        <li>3 eggs</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>4 cups shredded Cheddar cheese</li>
        <li>1 pinch paprika, or to taste (Optional)</li>
    </ul>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Spray a 9x13-inch casserole dish with cooking spray.</li>
        <li>Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a boil. 
            Stir in the macaroni and return to a boil. Cook pasta uncovered, 
            stirring occasionally, until it has cooked through but is still 
            slightly firm, about 8 minutes; drain.</li>
        <li>Slowly melt butter in a large pot over low heat. 
            Stir in evaporated milk and black pepper; cook until heated through.</li>
        <li>Whisk eggs in a bowl until smooth; whisk about 1/2 cup of the 
            evaporated milk mixture into the eggs, 1 tablespoon at a time,
             until thoroughly incorporated. Whisk the egg mixture back into 
             the saucepan with evaporated milk mixture. Continue to heat gently, 
             whisking constantly, until the evaporated milk mixture almost 
             comes to a simmer and the sauce thickens.</li>
        <li>Gently mix salt and cooked macaroni into the sauce and stir to combine.</li>
        <li>Spoon 1/4 of the macaroni mixture in a layer into the bottom of the 
            prepared casserole dish and top with 1 cup shredded Cheddar cheese. 
            Repeat layers three more times; top last cheese layer with paprika to taste.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until casserole is bubbling, about 20 minutes.</li>
    </ol>
